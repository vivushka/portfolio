    <h3>I'm a front-end developer from Kyiv, Ukraine</h3>

      <p class="first-text">
        My story of entering the IT industry began during the COVID-19
        quarantine, when I successfully completed online web design courses, and
        even created several projects for my portfolio.<br />
        Right now there is a tough war going on in my country and for the moment
        I can stay in a safe area and I just recently got the opportunity to
        study at SheCodes Foundation. Over the past few months of study, I have
        undertaken several projects using HTML/CSS/JS. In addition to I`ve got
        knowledge in API, Bootstrap, Ajax, GitHub and I can provide some UI/UX
        design services.
